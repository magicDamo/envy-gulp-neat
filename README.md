> A Note About Bourbon / Neat

Thanks for the opportunity to look into Bourbon and Neat. This is my first time to work with Bourbon / Neat. And generally speaking I work with LESS, however conceptually LESS and SASS are pretty similar. The 'Neat' usage was interesting and as I was able to gain some plyability with it.
Now that this is fairily complete, I would have preferred to have taken a 'mobile first approach' ( my default approach).
In my journeys I also discovered some cool compontents ( refills) that i will definitely be re-visiting and using in the near future.
