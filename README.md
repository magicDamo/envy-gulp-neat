* I have not miniifed / created a build process for this code test, genearlly speaking , a minfied / concantenated build is part of the process.
* Unit tests were not inclueded with this test as the functionality wasn't the goal for the project.


> A Note About Bourbon / Neat

Thanks for the opportunity to look into Bourbon and Neat. This is my first time to work with Bourbon / Neat. And generally speaking I work with LESS, however conceptually LESS and SASS are pretty similar. The 'Neat' usage was interesting and as I was able to gain some plyability with it.
I implemented a 'mobile first' approach, this was interesting.
In my journeys I also discovered some cool compontents ( refills) that i will definitely be re-visiting and using in the near future.

I have accomodated for views for portrait phone  / portrait tablet and desktop.

In mobile,  you can close the menu by selecting any menu item.
